Overview of the Game:
The idea of the project is a fun game where the Player must escape the Zombies before getting caught. The player runs through a maze-like map with guns able to shoot the zombies in a 3D environment using keyboard controls WASD for movement, C for camera changes and Mouse Click 1 for Shooting bullets. The goal of the game is to complete the maze-like map and run to the Ninja who is waiting for you before the zombies get to you.
The main parts of the game are:

•	Player – Astronaut, moved with the keyboard WASD and shoots with Mouse Click 1

•	Camera – Able to switch the cameras (3 in total) by clicking the keyboard button “C”

•	Enemies –Zombies! they are all over the place roaming around and waiting for a meal. They will run and attack you are seen in their P.O.V.

•	Death! – Zombies will insta kill the Player. Player can shoot the Zombies.

•	Lives – Only 1 Health Point for either.

Game features:
•	Maze-like Map with 1 moving Wall if the player is patient enough.
